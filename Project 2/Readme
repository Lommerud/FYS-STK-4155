The main aim of this project is to study both classification and regression problems by developing our own feed-forward neural network (FFNN) code. We can reuse the regression algorithms studied in project 1. We will also include logistic regression for classification problems and write our own FFNN code for studying both regression and classification problems. The codes developed in project 1, including bootstrap and/or cross-validation as well as the computation of the mean-squared error and/or the R2 or the accuracy score (classification problems) functions can also be utilized in the present analysis.
